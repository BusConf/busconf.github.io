<h3>Register Your Interest</h3>
    <p class="intro">
      Tickets are not yet available but you can already register your interest to attend the event. Doing so will put you at the front of the queue should we ever run out of tickets. It also helps us to get an idea how many atteendees we might be expecting. Registering your interest does *not* come with any obligations on your end. That being said, don't register if you have no plans to come ;)
