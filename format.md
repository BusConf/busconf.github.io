<p class="intro">
<b>BusConf</b> is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Space_Technology">Open Space</a> unconference. This means there is no fixed program. What takes place at <b>BusConf</b> is what those attending BusConf want to happen. We just provide the logistics. Ever noticed how coffee breaks at traditional conferences can lead to the most interesting discussions with like-minded people? Think of BusConf as the ultimate coffee break with delicious FP-flavored coffee.

<h3>So how does it work?</h3>

<p class="intro">
Each morning we will gather to create the schedule for the day. Anyone can step forward to create a session. Sessions can take quite different shapes:
</p>

<h4>A discussion</h4>
  <p class="intro">
  You might be looking for input on a topic that is important for you. A discussion is a great way to get new perspectives from peers in the FP community.
  </p>

<h4>A talk</h4>
  <p class="intro">
  You can also run your session as a presentation with slides and Q&A!
  </p>

<h4>A request</h4>
  <p class="intro">
  We all have topics we’d love to research further. Perhaps you haven’t had time, or struggled to get started. Now’s your moment to do it with others
  </p>

<h4>A hands-on session</h4>
  <p class="intro">
  Another popular kind of session is the hands-on or workshop session. Run a Pair- or Mob-Programming Session, solve katas or exercises together. Code away!
  </p>

<p class="intro">
You are not limited to those examples either: Just propose <b>anything</b> that you and the others at the event might enjoy.
</p>

<p class="intro">
Each proposed session will be put on our schedule with the info who runs the session and where it will take place. Of course not everyone needs to run a session. Attending and asking questions during a session is just as important.
