<p class="intro">
<b>BusConf</b> is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Space_Technology">Open Space</a> unonference. This means there is no fixed program. What takes place at <b>BusConf</b> is what those attending BusConf want to happen. We just provide the logistics. Ever noticed how coffee breaks at traditional conferences can lead to the most interesting discussions with like minded people? Think of BusConf as the ultimate coffee break with delicious FP flavored coffee.

<h3>So how does it work?</h3>

<p class="intro">
Each morning we will gather to create the schedule for the day. Anyone can step forward to create a session. A session can take quite different shapes:
</p>

<h4>A discussion</h4>
  <p class="intro">
  You might be looking for input on a topic that is important for you. A discussion is a great way to get new perspectives from peers in the FP community.
  </p>

<h4>A talk</h4>
  <p class="intro">
  Perhaps you still have slides on your laptop from a talk you have previously given elsewhere. It might be interesting to the others!
  </p>

<h4>A request</h4>
  <p class="intro">
  Another motivation to propose a session is if you want to something about a topic that has always interested you still haven't had the chance to look into or struggled to get started. Just ask if there are others that either already experienced in that topic or would like to join you to explore it together during your session.
  </p>

<h4>A hands-on session</h4>
  <p class="intro">
  Another popular kind of session is the hands-on or workshop session. Run a Pair- or Mob-Programming Session, solve katas or exercises together. Code away!
  </p>

<p class="intro">
You are not limited to those examples either: Just propose <b>anything</b> that you and the others at the event might enjoy.
</p>

<p class="intro">
Each proposed session will be put on our schedule with the info who runs the session and where it will take place. Of course not everyone needs to run a session. Attending and asking questions during a session is just as important.
